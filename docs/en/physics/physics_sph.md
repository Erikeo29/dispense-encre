## 1. Method Principle

The **SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)** method is a **Lagrangian** and **meshless** approach where the fluid is represented by a set of mobile particles carrying physical properties.

### Main Variable: Particles

Unlike grid-based methods (VOF, FEM, LBM), there are no fixed connections between points. The value of a property A at position **r** is calculated by **interpolation**:

$$A(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_b m_b \frac{A_b}{\rho_b} W(|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_b|, h)$$

where b denotes each **neighbor** particle within the influence radius:
- $m_b$ = mass of neighbor particle b
- $A_b$ = value of property A carried by particle b
- $\rho_b$ = density of particle b
- $\mathbf{r}_b$ = position of particle b
- $W$ = **smoothing kernel** (weight function)
- $h$ = **smoothing length** (influence radius)

**Key Advantage:** Natural handling of complex free surfaces (breakup, splashing) without mesh deformation.

## 2. Fundamental Equations

### 2.1 Momentum Equation

$$m_a \frac{d\mathbf{v}_a}{dt} = -\sum_b m_b \left(\frac{p_a}{\rho_a^2} + \frac{p_b}{\rho_b^2} + \Pi_{ab}\right) \nabla_a W_{ab} + \mathbf{f}_\sigma$$

where a is the **target** particle and b its **neighbor** particles:
- $m_a$, $m_b$ = masses of target particle a and neighbor particle b
- $\mathbf{v}_a$ = velocity of particle a
- $p_a$, $p_b$ = pressures of particles a and b
- $\rho_a$, $\rho_b$ = densities of particles a and b
- $\Pi_{ab}$ = artificial viscosity term
- $\nabla_a W_{ab}$ = smoothing kernel gradient between particles a and b
- $\mathbf{f}_\sigma$ = surface tension force

### 2.2 Equation of State (Weakly Compressible)

$$p = c_0^2 (\rho - \rho_0) \quad \text{or} \quad p = B\left[\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^\gamma - 1\right]$$

where:
- $p$ = pressure
- $\rho$ = local density
- $\rho_0$ = reference density
- $c_0$ = 10·$v_{max}$ (numerical speed of sound)
- $B$ = pressure constant
- $\gamma$ = 7 for liquids

### 2.3 Surface Tension (Adapted CSF)

$$\mathbf{F}_{st} = -\sigma \kappa \mathbf{n}$$

where:
- $\sigma$ = surface tension coefficient
- $\kappa$ = interface curvature
- $\mathbf{n}$ = ∇c, normal calculated from the color field gradient c

## 3. Mathematical Formulation

### 3.1 Cubic Spline Smoothing Kernel

| Domain | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| 0 ≤ q < 1 | W(q) = σ_d/h^d · (1 - 3q²/2 + 3q³/4) |
| 1 ≤ q < 2 | W(q) = σ_d/h^d · (2-q)³/4 |
| q ≥ 2 | W(q) = 0 |

where:
- $q$ = $r/h$, normalized distance between two particles
- $\sigma_d$ = normalization factor (depends on dimension $d$)
- $h$ = smoothing length
- $d$ = number of spatial dimensions (2 or 3)

### 3.2 Artificial Viscosity (Monaghan)

| Condition | Π_ab |
|-----------|------|
| **v**_ab · **r**_ab < 0 | Π_ab = (-α c̄_ab μ_ab + β μ_ab²) / ρ̄_ab |
| otherwise | Π_ab = 0 |

where:
- $\mathbf{v}_{ab}$ = $\mathbf{v}_a - \mathbf{v}_b$, relative velocity
- $\mathbf{r}_{ab}$ = $\mathbf{r}_a - \mathbf{r}_b$, relative position
- $\bar{c}_{ab}$ = average speed of sound between a and b
- $\mu_{ab}$ = $h \mathbf{v}_{ab} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ab} / (|\mathbf{r}_{ab}|^2 + \epsilon h^2)$
- $\bar{\rho}_{ab}$ = average density between a and b
- $\alpha$, $\beta$ = artificial viscosity coefficients

**Typical parameters:** α = 0.1, β = 0

### 3.3 Boundary Conditions (Ghost Particles)

Walls are made of layers of fixed **ghost particles** that:
- Exert a repulsive pressure
- Impose the no-slip condition
- Extrapolate properties from the fluid

### 3.4 Non-Newtonian Fluids

The stress tensor depends on the shear rate:

$$\boldsymbol{\tau}_a = K|\dot{\gamma}_a|^{n-1} \dot{\gamma}_a$$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\tau}_a$ = stress tensor of particle a
- $K$ = consistency index (Pa·s$^n$)
- $\dot{\gamma}_a$ = local shear rate
- $n$ = flow behavior index ($n < 1$: shear-thinning)

**SPH Advantage:** Natural handling of **thixotropy** (time-dependent viscosity) thanks to the Lagrangian approach.

## 4. Advantages and Limitations

| Advantages | Limitations |
|------------|-------------|
| Complex free surfaces (breakup, splashing) | Numerical noise (pressure oscillations) |
| Exact advection (no numerical diffusion) | Difficult boundary conditions |
| Natural coalescence | High memory cost (10⁶ particles) |

## 5. Computational Cost

**Reference domain:** 1.2 mm × 0.5 mm (micro-via dispensing)

| Configuration | Particles | Spacing | Time | Hardware |
|---------------|-----------|---------|------|----------|
| **This project** | ~1k | 15–20 µm | **1–2 h** | 6 cores |
| High resolution | ~10k | 5–10 µm | 4–8 h | 8 cores |
| 3D standard | ~1M | 5 µm | 5–10 h | GPU |

> **Interpretation:** ~1000 particles on 1.2×0.5 mm yield an average spacing of 15–20 µm. The smoothing length $h$ is typically 1.3× this spacing. Unoptimized PySPH code.

**GPU Acceleration:** x10–x15 vs CPU for simulations > 100k particles.
