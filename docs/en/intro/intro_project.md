# Modeling of Shear-Thinning Fluid Dispensing

## 1. Scientific and Industrial Context

### 1.1 Microfluidic Dispensing Technologies

Microfluidic dispensing encompasses a set of techniques for controlled deposition of volumes ranging from nanoliters to microliters. These processes find applications in numerous industrial fields:

- Electrochemical sensor fabrication: ink deposition for reference electrode, conductive electrode, chemical or biochemical functionalization...
- Printed electronics: conductive circuits, RFID antennas, module packaging...
- Functional coatings and thin films.
- Precision pharmaceutical dosing.

### 1.2 Physical Mechanisms

Fluid dispensing involves several coupled physical phenomena:
- **Two-phase flow**: fluid/air interaction at the interface.
- **Capillarity**: surface tension and wall wetting.
- **Rheology**: non-Newtonian behavior of complex fluids.
- **Interface dynamics**: deformation, spreading, pinch-off.

## 2. Properties of Shear-Thinning Fluids

### 2.1 Non-Newtonian Behavior

Shear-thinning fluids are **non-Newtonian fluids** whose apparent viscosity decreases under shear stress. This behavior is essential for dispensing: the fluid flows easily under pressure but maintains its shape at rest.

**Power law (Ostwald-de Waele):**

$$\tau = K\dot{\gamma}^n \quad \text{with } n < 1$$

where $\tau$ is the shear stress, $K$ the consistency index, $\dot{\gamma}$ the shear rate, and $n$ the behavior index.

### 2.2 Carreau-Yasuda Model

$$\eta(\dot{\gamma}) = \eta_\infty + \frac{\eta_0 - \eta_\infty}{[1 + (k\dot{\gamma})^a]^{(1-n)/a}}$$

where $\eta_0$ and $\eta_\infty$ are the zero-shear and infinite-shear viscosities, and $k$, $a$ are fitting parameters.

**Example:** A shear-thinning ink can exhibit $\eta_0 = 0.5$–$15$ Pa·s (at rest) and $\eta_\infty = 0.05$ Pa·s under high shear.

### 4.1 Geometric Configuration

The modeled system consists of:
- **Dispensing nozzle**: diameter 200–350 µm, positioned above the micro-via.
- **Micro-via**: diameter 800–1500 µm, depth ~130 µm.
- **Fluid**: shear-thinning ink ($\rho$ = 3000 kg/m³).
- **Environment**: ambient temperature (~20°C) and atmospheric pressure.
